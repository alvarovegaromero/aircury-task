Tecnhical task done for a job application in @Aircury

This program solves puzzles where each piece is defined by a row in a file, with sides are represented by positive integers. Matching integers indicate matching sides, while 0s represent borders and must be placed on the puzzle's edge. The program flips and tests each piece to fit it into the current space.
